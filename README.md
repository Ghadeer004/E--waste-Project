# ♻️ E-Waste Classification with Hybrid Deep Learning

This project implements a hybrid deep learning model combining EfficientNetB0, MobileNetV2, and a Sequential Neural Network (SNN) to classify electronic waste images.

The model is optimized for deployment on low-power edge devices using TensorFlow Lite Dynamic Quantization.

## 🔍 Key Features
- Hybrid CNN architecture (EfficientNet + MobileNet + SNN)
- High-accuracy e-waste image classification
- TensorFlow Lite model compression
- Reduced inference time, model size, and energy consumption
- Comparison between original and quantized models

## 📊 Results
- ~94% classification accuracy  
- ~75% reduction in model size  
- ~70% faster inference  
- ~70% lower energy usage  

## 🛠 Technologies
- TensorFlow / Keras  
- TensorFlow Lite  
- Python  
- Google Colab  

This project demonstrates how model compression enables efficient AI deployment for sustainable e-waste management.
